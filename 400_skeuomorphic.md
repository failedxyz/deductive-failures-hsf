As the hint suggests, the answer is in the wallpaper. The wallpaper image `warty-final-ubuntu.jpg` stored inside `~/Pictures/Wallpapers` appears to be the right file.

At the end of that file, it says `Flag:{l00ks_C4n_B3_D}`, which the problem doesn't seem to accept. Makes sense, since what appears to be the word "deceiving" isn't complete.

At this point, I looked up what the word skeuomorphic meant. According to Reference.com, a skeuomorph is

> an ornament or design on an object copied from a form of the object when made from another material or by other techniques, as an imitation metal rivet mark found on handles of prehistoric pottery.

So that means there's another image somewhere on the hard drive that is probably a larger version of this 146x91 image.
