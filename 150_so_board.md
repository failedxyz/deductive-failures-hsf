# 150 So Board

> The flag is on the site :3

It's on the scoreboard. There's 5 parts, and part 2 can be found in the West scoreboard link.

```html
<div class="small-12 large-2 columns">
    <a href="/scoreboard/west" onclick="part_2 = 'th4t_m0ment_'" class="button expand">West</a>
</div>
```

You can try to find each part, or just go into your console and type `part_1 + part_2 + part_3 + part_4 + part_5` and it should give you the flag.
