Since I was the only one on the team to have not-crappy internet, I ended up solving it myself. Aside from taking forever to download, this problem actually wasn't too bad.

So the first thing I did was browse the VM for any clues. Inside the user's home directory, there seems to be a random `catz` file, keylogger program, and a `veracrypt` installer. `file`ing the catz file didn't help; it just said it was "data". We can confirm that both `logkeys` and `veracrypt` have already been installed on the system.

Since we don't know anything about `veracrypt`, we'll focus on `logkeys` first. I tried to diff the `logkeys` on the VM with the legit `logkeys` to see if it had been tampered with, but I didn't find anything special. Let's first run `logkeys`. Running it produced a list of options we could use. Immediately I noticed that there was a default output file.

Sure enough, there was a `logkeys.log` file inside `/var/log`. So it seems that whoever used this VM before must have already gotten keylogged. We can use the log to figure out what the person who used this VM did to create the `catz` file. Let's take a look at the log file.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
wget https://logkeys.googlecode.com/files/logkeys-.01.1a.tar.gz
wget https://logkeys.googlecode.com/files/logkeys-0.1.1a.tar.gz
tar xvzf logkeys-0.1.1a.tar.gz
cd logkeys-0.1.1a/
./configure
make
sudo make install

I'm still kinda confused how the keylogger was able to log anything before `sudo logkeys -s`. Weird.

So it seems that `catz` is a volume of files created by `veracrypt`. The flag is most likely hidden on this volume. Since `veracrypt` is already installed, we can just use that to mount the volume. From the log file, we know that the password is `Me0wL3tMeInPl$`, and there seems to be no keyfile used. 

```
cats@ubuntu:~$ veracrypt --mount catz
Enter mount directory [default]:
Enter password for /home/cats/catz:
Enter keyfile [none]:
Protect hidden volume (if any)? (y=Yes/n=No) [No]:
Enter your user password or administrator password:
```

It's a volume containing a bunch of PDFs and images. Let's try the PDFs first. I did a quick Google search on `extract resources from pdf linux`, and found that Ubuntu has tools preinstalled for extracting things out of PDFs :D.

So there's `pdfimages` and `pdftotext`, but `pdftohtml` should be able to do it all. I `pdftohtml`ed all the files, and then `grep`ed for "flag" and sure enough, the flag was there!
