# 100 What's Good?

Looking at the source code of the site, there's nothing that really stands out, other than the skeleton playing a trumpet and the link to [/whereyouat](http://54.152.176.49/whereyouat).

```bash
{ ~ }  Â» nc 54.152.176.49 80
GET /whereyouat HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

Performing a simple `GET` on `/whereyouat` using netcat reveals that the flag is in the header.
