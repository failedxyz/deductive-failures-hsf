# 500 Where is My Key

> Well this is embarrassing. I was writing a program that I could use to send encrypted messages between my friend and me, but somehow I managed to lose my key and the original message that I sent to my friend. I have a message and it's encrypted version from when I still had the key, but I really want to get back the second message that I sent. Can you help me?
